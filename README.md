# Hello, I'm Vyxen

I’m a passionate learner with a strong interest in computing and cybersecurity. I enjoy building practical projects — from Node.js bots and client websites to experimenting with AI models and VRChat world design. My curiosity drives me to explore both the creative and technical sides of technology, giving me a unique perspective on problem-solving. Currently, I’m working toward professional cybersecurity certifications to strengthen my skills and prepare for a career in the field.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) or Security Analyst at an entry level.

## My Values

Curiosity – I constantly seek out new challenges and technologies, whether it’s exploring penetration testing with Kali Linux or experimenting with AI.
Integrity – I value honesty and responsibility, especially in cybersecurity where trust is pivotal.
Creativity – I take pride in combining logical thinking with design, from developing tools to creating immersive digital spaces.
Persistence – I approach problems with determination and patience, always working hard towards effective solutions.
Collaboration – I believe technology's purpose is for ideas to be shared in a collaborative effort, and I enjoy learning and growing alongside others.

## Professional Statement

I am an adaptable and curious learner with a strong foundation in computing and a growing expertise in cybersecurity. My values of integrity, persistence, and collaboration guide how I approach challenges, ensuring that I handle sensitive information responsibly and work effectively within a team. By combining creativity with technical skills, I can identify and solve problems in innovative ways, from automating workflows to analyzing network activity with tools like Wireshark and Kali Linux.

My goal is to apply these strengths within a Security Operations Center or security analyst role, where I can help organizations achieve their security objectives by detecting threats, improving defenses, and protecting critical assets.
